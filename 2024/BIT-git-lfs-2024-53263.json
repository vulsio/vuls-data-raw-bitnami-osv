	"details": "Git LFS is a Git extension for versioning large files. When Git LFS requests credentials from Git for a remote host, it passes portions of the host's URL to the `git-credential(1)` command without checking for embedded line-ending control characters, and then sends any credentials it receives back from the Git credential helper to the remote host. By inserting URL-encoded control characters such as line feed (LF) or carriage return (CR) characters into the URL, an attacker may be able to retrieve a user's Git credentials. This problem exists in all previous versions and is patched in v3.6.1. All users should upgrade to v3.6.1. There are no workarounds known at this time.",
