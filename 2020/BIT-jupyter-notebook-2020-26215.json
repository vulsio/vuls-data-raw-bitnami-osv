	"details": "Jupyter Notebook before version 6.1.5 has an Open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to a notebook server could redirect the browser to a different website. All notebook servers are technically affected, however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made for known notebook server hosts. A link to your notebook server may appear safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the public internet. The issue is patched in version 6.1.5.",
